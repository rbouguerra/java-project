          Formation JAVA
**********************************************

1/ class ==> Collection of variables and methods
2/ main() ==> method can be present in same class
3/ main() ==< method can be present in separate class


Data Types in java:
1/ Premetive data type: int/ double/char/boolean/short/float.....
2/ Drived data types: Array/ArrayList/String/ Hashmap....

***********************************
Part 1

Empl==> OOP => Object Oriented programming

Object==> is an instance of a class
Method==> block of code wich contain a logic

Class Variables 

We can assign values to variables in 3 ways
1/By using reference variable
2/By using method
3/By using constructor

-----------------------

Methods:==> Block of code
1/case-1:Not tacking parameters and also not returned any value
2/ case-2:Not tacking parameters but returning value
3/case-3:Tacking parameters but not returning any value
4/case4:Tacking parameters and also returning a value

Constructor

Types Constructor
1/Default constructor
2/Parameterized constructor

1/A special type of method
2/Used for initializing the class variable
3/Name should be same as class name
4/Will not return any value
5/Will invoke at the time of object creation

Part 2 
---------
- Overloading
- this Keyword
- static variables and static method
--------------------------------------
Overloading: Creating methods / constructors with the same name with diffrent parameters
Advantages:
1/Save memory
2/Save Time

static variables and static method
static ==> applicable for varibles and methods
*/static varible
*/static method

1/static method can access only static stuff(directly)==>without create an object
2/static method can also access non static stuff but through object
3/Non static methods can access both static and non static stuff direct (True)

Part 3
************
Java inheritance
Method overriding
super keyword
final keyword
***********************

Java inheritance (HÃ©ritage)
*/Aquiring all The properties from one class to another class is called Inheritance
5 Types of Inheritance
1/Single
2/Multilevel
3/Hierarchical
4/Multiple
5/Hybrid
********************
Method overriding
Rewrite the methods in child classes:
1/Methods difinition should be same
2/Body should be changed

Overloading                                          | Overriding
1/Change the difinition of methods                     - We don't change th edifinition
(number and data of parameter)should be different      - we should change only the body

**************************
super keyword

==> use in Inheritance
1/super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable
2/super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method
3/super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor


***********************
final keyword
Variable==> you cannot change the value of the variable
Method==> method cannot be overrid in the child class
Class==> class cannot be extend into another class
*********************

Java Interface
Java package 
Access Modifier's

*********************
Java Interface

* An interface in java is a blueprint of a class
* Interface contains final and static variables
* Interface contains abstract methods
==> An abstract method is a method contains defintion but not body
* Method in interface are public by default
* interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance
* we can define interface with interface keyword
* A class extends another class an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface
* We can create object refrence for interface but we cannot instantiate interface


Java package 
Package: is collection of classes / interfaces / files ....
import ==> is a commande
2 Types of packages:
1/ User defined packages (Create by us)
2/ Build in packages


Access Modifier's
******************************
Access modifier's:Define the scope of variables and methods

1/Public
2/Protected
3/Default
4/Private

Private: The private access modifier is accessible only within class

Default:if you don't use any modifier, it is treated as default by default
The default modifier is accessible only within package

Protected: The protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package but though inheritance

Public:
We can access everywhere

Exception Handling
Exception is an abnormal condition
In java, exception is an event that distupts the normal flow of the program.

2 Types of exception:

1/Checked Exception:identified by the compiler
Examples: 
InterruptedException
IOException
FileNotFoundException

2/Unchecked exception : which are not checked / identified by compiler
Examples:
- ArthmeticException
- NullPointerException
- NumberFormatException
- ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


Finally Block is always executes
1/Exception doesn't occur
2/Exception occurs and not handled
3/Exception occurs and handled

CheckedException
can be handled in 2 ways:
1/try---catch
2/throws keyword

***************************

ArrayList
HashMap
JDBC=Java DataBase Connectivity

***************************
ArrayList

int a []= new int [5];==> simple Array
-we cannot store more then 5 elments 
- we cannot store multiple types of elements(int)

ArrayList==> we can store any number and types of elements

Operation on ArrayList
- How to declare arraylist
- How to add elements /values to arraylist
- Find size of arraylist
- Read values from arraylist
- remove elements / values from arraylist
- Insert a new element in the middle of arraylist
**********************************
HashMap

Declare Hadhmap
Remove element from hashmap
Read pairs for hashmap
Add elements to hashmap
